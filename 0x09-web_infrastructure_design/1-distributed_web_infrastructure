For every additional element, why you are adding it?:

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?:
Round Robin. Involves a cyclical sequential distribution of request to servers and is ideal for a throng comprising of identical servers.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
Is enabling Active-Passive setup. While Active-Passive operates load balancers, it has the ability to maintain uninterrupted service for our customers, instead Active-Active configuration is capable to deliver a service where two or more servers aggregate the network traffic load and working as a team distributes it to the network servers.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?:
Master-slave replication enables data from one database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more other database servers (the slaves). The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves. The slave outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of subsequent updates. Master-slave replication can be either synchronous or asynchronous. The difference is simply the timing of propagation of changes. If the changes are made to the master and slave at the same time, it is synchronous. If changes are queued up and written later, it is asynchronous.


What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application:
A primary node receive all requests and then synchronizes the changes to all replica nodes. Just in case the primary node fails, the replica node will re-elect a primary node
